FMH Omega

Calculate dn/ds ratio at a genomic level, which is the ratio of nonsynonymous mutations to synonymous mutations, using FracMinHash sketches.

To run, simply invoke the `nohup bash run_fmh_omega.sh > log 2>&1 &` script. Other scripts are supporting scripts.

If you need memory information, invoke `nohup /usr/bin/time -v bash run_fmh_omega.sh > log 2>&1 &`
